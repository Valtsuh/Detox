
	Version notes.
	Added / included / written since 0.4.4.1

	Note for likely code-editors: Please post feedback, thank you. 
	Another note, for coders, check your switches and breaks. 
		Also, while coding windows (console, not sure for graphical), 
		incase of the dreaded error 87(invalid parameter), 
		likely solution is to enlargen the whole window (desk size (pixels), hidden, seemed to work for me), 
		before attempting to resize the buffer.
		
	Still baffling with bit stuff, no idea how a fresh array (not even initialized) gets filled with (more or less) random ASCII. 

	Default settings:
		- Camera on
		- Map 32 / 16 tiles size
		- Max 8 creatures
		- Auto on, 2.5 second rate
		- Creatures do not attack player

		[To-do]
			- After a semi-large revamp, some arrays have false values, no idea how or why, something somewhere where something shouldn't be or exist.
			- Options for enabling / disabling interfaces (lower resolution play(off-screen))
			- Options for maturity (Some might find content pg)
			- Options for camera (More indepth)
			- Whole options revamp
			- Values still not correct / buggy ( Skill exponential numberistics are still a wild mystery (initializing as floats did nothing))
			- Probable tile bugs, tiles disappearing unintended, wrong tile colors, fixing as I notice
			- Very / highly unbalanced
			- Terminologies
			- Behavioural / playal difference between modes (effects before / after round / loop).
			- Resource fixes
			- Possible crash fixes
			- Type revamp
			- Text lengths overlapping

			[Likely]
				- New items
				- Map improvements (visual)
				- Creature names
				- Mode correction (Auto)
				- New mode

			[Consideration]
				- Building
				- Crafting
				- Resource generation(other than appearance)
				- Neutral characters
				- Saving
				- Port to android (drawn graphics), google play and so forth.

			[Very unlikely]
				- Touch controls for manual mode
		
		[Idea-ball]
			- Possibly some sort of multiplayer/multiwatch, with each communicating with each
				(Multi-open on same computer, possibly multi-open on different computers)
			- A version with actually drawn graphics (non-ASCII), most of the necessities exist
			- Yet to discover how templates actually work ( the '<' & '>' are more or less confusing)
			- Some sort of theme-type of thing, relative(ish) to Minecrafts climates

		- Possibilities of, expanding to server-side, user written content(external filing, still a long way to go).
		- Plenty of minor fixing (bugs, out of place, etc), likely to tweak and fix more as i notice them.
		- Becoming difficult / hard to stay within low resolution boundaries, due to long / increasinly long messages,
			likely to make a limited yet playable version for lower resolutions.
