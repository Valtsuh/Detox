
	Version notes.
	Added / included / written since 0.4.4.1

	Note for likely code-editors: Please post feedback, thank you. 

	- 0.5.4.1
		[General]
		- Cleaned up version of version notes (ta-da)

		[Added]
		- Genders
		- Inventory

		[Code]
		- Re-wrote a lot, due to code being very complicated and scarce(was even confusing myself)
		- Plenty of definitions / re-definitions
		- Removed a lot of unnecessary / redundant code
		
		[To-do]
		- Name generator
		- Some sort of log
		- Inventory tweaks
		- Likely / probable to re-write the whole rendeder, or at least some parts of it
		- As far as I can tell, plenty of minor/outer tweaks

	- 0.4.4.1
		- New skill added

		- A lot of new code / overcoding (rewritten), preparing / getting ready for more complexity, versatility and an actual release.
		- Possibilities of, expanding to server-side, user written content(external filing, still a long way to go).
		- Plenty of minor fixing (bugs, out of place, etc), likely to tweak and fix more as i notice them.
		- Becoming difficult / hard to stay within low resolution boundaries, due to long / increasinly long messages,
			likely to make a limited yet playable version for lower resolutions.
