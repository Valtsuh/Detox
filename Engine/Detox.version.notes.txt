
	Version notes.
	Added / included / written since 0.4.4.1

	Note for likely code-editors: Please post feedback, thank you. 
	Another note, for coders, check your switches and breaks. 
		Also, while coding windows (console, not sure for graphical), 
		incase of the dreaded error 87(invalid parameter), 
		likely solution is to enlargen the whole window (desk size (pixels), hidden, seemed to work for me), 
		before attempting to resize the buffer.
		
	Still baffling with bit stuff, no idea how a fresh array (not even initialized) gets filled with (more or less) random ASCII. 

	Default settings:
		- Camera on
		- Map 32 / 16 tiles size
		- Max 8 creatures
		- Auto on, 2.5 second rate
	//  - Creatures do not attack player

		[To-do]
			- After a semi-large revamp, some arrays have false values, no idea how or why, something somewhere where something shouldn't be or exist.
			- Options for enabling / disabling interfaces
			- Options for maturity (Some might find content pg)
			- Options for camera (More indepth)
			- Manual-camera mode buggy
			- Whole options revamp
			- Values still not correct / buggy ( Skill exponential numberistics are still a wild mystery (initializing as floats did nothing))
			- Probable tile bugs, tiles disappearing unintended, wrong tile colors, fixing as I notice
			- Very / highly unbalanced
			- Terminologies
			- Behaviour difference between auto / manual modes (effects before / after round / loop).
			- Connection / connecting (or something, still thought)
			- Possible sound effects
			- Resource fixes
			- Possible crash fixes
			- Type revamp
			- Text lengths overlapping
		
		[Idea-ball]
			- Possibly some sort of multiplayer/multiwatch, with each communicating with each
				(Multi-open on same computer, possibly multi-open on different computers)
			- A version with actually drawn graphics (non-ASCII), most of the necessities exist
			- Yet to discover how templates actually work ( the '<' & '>' are more or less confusing)
			- Some sort of theme-type of thing, relative(ish) to Minecrafts climates
			

	- 0.8.5.3
		[Common]
			- Creature appearance messages moved to log.
			- Creature appearance now needs an additional chance.
			- Creatures now attack each other, based on chance.
			- Creatures can die.

			- Creatures reappear. (up to limit, choosable from options, as new/fresh)
			- Software (->) related information are now shown. (V from the menu)
			- Player now attacks creatures, based on chance.
			- Player gains experience.
			- Camera-map functioanlity should now be fixed (not yet tweaked).
		[Balancing]
			- Creature adaptation loss now scales with map size.
			- Player movement chance now scales with map size.
			- Player camera now scales with map size.
			[Numbers]
				- Player movement, tiny map, is now 54 (up from 50)
				- Player movement, small map, is now 46 (down from 50)
				- Player movement, average map, is now 38 (down from 50)
				- Player movement, large map, is now 30 (down from 50)

		[Minor / fix]

		[Outer / tweak]
			- Event chances incorrect.

		[General]
		[Balancing]

	- 0.6.4.1
		[General]
			- Preparations for extensitivities/complexities
			- As is now, should be playable / compatible with over 900 pixel wide resolutions without going out of the screen
				under 900 wide resolutions, would be playable, but would go out of the screen.

		[Added]
			- Personalities
			- New items
			- Log

		[Code]
			- Interfaces re-coded, majorly 

		[Minor / fix]

	- 0.5.4.1
		[General]
		- Cleaned up version of version notes (ta-da)

		[Added]
		- Genders
		- Inventory

		[Code]
		- Re-wrote a lot, due to code being very complicated and scarce(was even confusing myself)
		- Plenty of definitions / re-definitions
		- Removed a lot of unnecessary / redundant code
		
		[To-do]
		- Name generator
		- Some sort of log
		- Inventory tweaks

		- As far as I can tell, plenty of minor/outer tweaks

	- 0.4.4.1
		- New skill added

		- A lot of new code / overcoding (rewritten), preparing / getting ready for more complexity, versatility and an actual release.
		- Possibilities of, expanding to server-side, user written content(external filing, still a long way to go).
		- Plenty of minor fixing (bugs, out of place, etc), likely to tweak and fix more as i notice them.
		- Becoming difficult / hard to stay within low resolution boundaries, due to long / increasinly long messages,
			likely to make a limited yet playable version for lower resolutions.
