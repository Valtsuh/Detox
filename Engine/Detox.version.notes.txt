		[To-do]

		- As far as I can tell, plenty of minor/outer tweaks

	- 0.4.4.1
		- New skill added

		- A lot of new code / overcoding (rewritten), preparing / getting ready for more complexity, versatility and an actual release.
		- Possibilities of, expanding to server-side, user written content(external filing, still a long way to go).
		- Plenty of minor fixing (bugs, out of place, etc), likely to tweak and fix more as i notice them.
		- Becoming difficult / hard to stay within low resolution boundaries, due to long / increasinly long messages,
			likely to make a limited yet playable version for lower resolutions.
