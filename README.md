An engine project. Early version, plenty to-do and update. Open to ideas. Names and structures subject to change.

<br>Inspired by, for example Dungeon Village by Kairosoft Co., Ltd. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kairosoft.android.bouken_en&hl=fi&gl=US)
<br>Which I've played my fair share of, among others. Great, great pieces of work of AI gaming.

<br>
Compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 16.9.1.

Ran with Windows 10.

<br> Note: Still learning / getting used to github.
