<br>Feedback more than welcome and appreciated

Aware:
 <br>-Cluttery scripts/scripting, slightly cleaned up.
 <br>-Statistics not showing properly
 <br>-Manual mode very buggy, unavailable.


Note: Had an earlier directory version, but could not figure out how this whole site works. 
<br>Another note: Would make some changes to earlier versions, but seems too complicated to re-upload, re-move files, change settings and save just for a few lines. A more thoroughly thought layout or at least a more new-user friendly, something, not much to go on if you're new and browsing the site for the first time. A lot of fancy words, but lacks a lot in layout and useability.

An engine project. Early version, plenty to-do and update. Open to ideas. Names and structures subject to change.

<br>Inspired by, for example Dungeon Village by Kairosoft Co., Ltd. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kairosoft.android.bouken_en&hl=fi&gl=US)
<br>Which I've played my fair share of, among others. Great, great pieces of work of AI gaming.

Compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 16.9.1.

Ran with Windows 10.

<br> Note: Still learning / getting used to github.

<br> NOTE: In no relation to GMiner(https://github.com/develsoftware/GMinerRelease/releases), literally a coincidence.
